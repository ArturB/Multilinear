- This module provides convenient constructors that generates a vector (tensor with one upper index) in array ("Data.Vector") implementation
- Choice of container type has great impact on library performance in particular use cases
- Array ("Data.Vector") implementation is generally faster, however it is strict and always keeps all tensor elements in memory, so it may require large amount of RAM.
- List implementation is slower but lazy and when tensor is generated from indices or randomly, it does not generate all elements at once if not necessary,
so it may operate in smaller memory (e.g. linear instead of quadratic when multiplying matrix by vector or form).
